# License Evolution Policy

This document outlines Vocalize's approach to potential future license changes.

## Current License (v1.0+)

As of January 2025, Vocalize is dual-licensed under:
- **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0** for non-commercial use
- **Commercial License** (by request) for commercial applications

## License Evolution Principles

1. **Version-Based Licensing**: License changes apply only to new versions
2. **Grandfathering**: Existing users retain rights under their original license
3. **Advance Notice**: Major license changes announced 3-6 months in advance
4. **Community Input**: Significant changes will include community consultation period

## Potential Future Directions

We may consider license adjustments based on:

### Factors for More Permissive Licensing
- Strong commercial license adoption providing sustainable revenue
- Corporate sponsorship or funding
- Community contributions reaching critical mass
- Strategic partnerships enabling sustainability

### Factors for More Restrictive Licensing
- Abuse of noncommercial license terms
- Unsustainable development costs
- Need for additional IP protection
- Market dynamics requiring stronger controls

## Version Rights Guarantee

**Your Rights Are Protected**:
- If you use Vocalize v1.x under current terms, you can continue using that version indefinitely
- Upgrading to new versions requires accepting new license terms
- Forking is allowed under license terms for any specific version

## License Change Process

1. **Evaluation Period**: Internal review of license effectiveness (quarterly)
2. **Community Announcement**: Public notice of proposed changes
3. **Feedback Period**: 30-day community comment period
4. **Final Decision**: Published with 90-day advance notice
5. **Implementation**: New license applies to next major version

## Historical Context

- **v1.0 (Jan 2025)**: Initial release with PolyForm Noncommercial + Commercial dual license
- **Future**: Evaluated based on adoption, sustainability, and community needs

## Commitment to Users

We commit to:
- Maintaining reasonable licensing terms
- Protecting existing user rights
- Providing clear communication about changes
- Considering community feedback seriously
- Ensuring sustainable project development
